# Senor Armando - Goliath Helpers

In Planet of the Apes, Se単or Armando is the owner of a circus, a human friend of Cornelius and Zira, and caregiver for Ceasar, teaching him human knowledge and introducing him to human habits.

On the Planet of the APIs, Se単or Armando is a collection of helper methods that introduce human habits to your goliath app.

Both have an enthusiastic appreciation for rich Corinthian leather.

## Setup

* run `armando_gemfile_jail`; this will run bundler install but cache the results locally for much quickness. **You MUST run it at least once explicitly**.

That should be it!
